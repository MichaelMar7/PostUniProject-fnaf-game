# fnaf java chatui edition build 1

Hello, this is my very first build for my first video game that I have made using the Java programming language (no frameworks). This game is based on Scott Cawthon's Five Nights at Freddy's game. However, this game is just a demo as most of the visuals for this game are not present and involves UI buttons and a chat system to play the game, but the mechanics in this demo will eventually be built upon to create a game that's visually closer to the original game.

The aim of this game is to survive a night from deadly animatronics. You can defend yourself using the cameras to track them and the doors to block them from entering your office. However, you only have a limited amount of power, so choose how often you use these resources carefully.

This demo only has three different nights that you can play which each have different difficulty.

How to play:

* Keep track of time on top-right corner of the screen and power on the bottom-left of the screen. Most of the important gameplay is on the left side of the screen.

* There are two door buttons and two lights buttons, used for the left and right doors respectively. Click on the button to toggle them on or off.

* There is a camera button, where hovering over it will toggle on and off the camera.

* You can click on the cam buttons to switch camera.

* Click on the "Check Cam" to see which animatronics are on that cam.

* Everytime you use the "Check Cam" on a cam with animatronics present or using the lights when an animatronic is at the door will cause chat messages to appear on the right side of the screen.

* You have six hours, survive by preventing animatronics from entering the room and don't run out of power (or something bad will happen).

NOTE: One of the animatronics has been disabled in this demo, because of the complexity of this animtronic and want to release this demo to be released (not intending to rush it).
